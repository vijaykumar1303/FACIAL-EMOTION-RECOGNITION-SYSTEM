# Facial Emotion Recognition System

## 📌 Overview
The **Facial Emotion Recognition System** is a machine learning-based project designed to detect human emotions from facial expressions. It leverages deep learning techniques to analyze facial features and classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutrality.

## 🛠️ Features
- Detects and classifies facial emotions in real-time
- Uses deep learning models (CNN, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras)
- Can be integrated with applications like chatbots, security systems, and user experience enhancements
- Supports real-time webcam input and image processing

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8+). Install required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project
1. **Train the Model** (if not using a pre-trained model):
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```
2. **Run Emotion Detection**:
   ```bash
   python src/detect.py
   ```

## 🔍 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Dataset
The system is trained using the **FER-2013** dataset, which contains labeled images of human facial expressions. The dataset is publicly available in Kaggle.

## 📈 Model Performance
The model achieves **high accuracy** on the test dataset and can be improved by fine-tuning hyperparameters and using a larger dataset.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Implementing a more robust deep learning model for better accuracy
- Deploying as a web or mobile application
- Enhancing real-time detection speed
